This game was created using Jquery (Javascript), bootstrap (CSS) and HTML. The goal was to create the game using raw coede without the help of any wisiwig eidtors. The main page shows 8 holes with moles slidding up and down from them. The cursor is a hammer which shows a whacking motion when clicked. each time that a mole is successfuly 'whacked' the mole turns into a bang sign then fades out of existence, and the user's scrore is adjusted accordingly. The goal of the game is for the user to mop as many moles as they can in 40 seconds.
