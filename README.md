This game was created using jquery (Javascript), Bootstrap (CSS) and HTML. The goal was to create the game using raw code without the help of wysiwyg eidtors. The game page shows 8 holes with moles slidding up and down from them, increasing in speed as the game goes on. The cursor is a hammer that animates a whacking motion when clicked. Each time that a mole is successfuly 'whacked', it turns into a bang sign then fades out of existence. And the user's scrore is adjusted accordingly. The goal of the game is for the user to beat the high score and thus set a new one by whacking as many moles as they can in 40 seconds.
